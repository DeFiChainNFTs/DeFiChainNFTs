FOMO on DeFiChain NFTs but still want cashflow? 
	This will be the way to go!!! 

What is the project?
        100 different DeFiChain NFTs will be generated each with a sale price of 250 DFI.  
        These DFI will be used for staking.  
        Each hodler of a NFT will receive weekly payouts of 1.4 DFI (0.2DFI/DAY).  
        If you hodl multiple NFTs you will receive multiple rewards.  

How are these high rewards possible?
        After 50 NFT sell, the sale funds will be used to create a Masternode and freeze it for 10 Years. Rewards will increase from 0.2 to 0.5 DFI per day.

Any chance of refund?
        Each NFT is backed with 200 DFI (from the sale) by myself. Therefore you have the chance to trade in your NFT for 200 DFI at anytime.
        In case of 50+ sales, the coin-refund option will be enabled after 50 days due to 10 Years freeze of the assets.(Note: You will not receive rewards anymore) 

What happens when I want to transfer my NFT to somebody else?
        If you wish to transfer your NFT to someone else, I need to be contacted in order to change the reward receiving address.

When will they be availabe?
        The NFTs will be minted in 1-2 weeks.

How can you get one?
        You will be able to purchase them on OpenSea, but I wouldnÂ´t recommend due to high gas fees. Instead you can contact me via Telegram or Twitter @DeFiChainNFTs and purchase via DFI.
